Secondary card). Given the factors, predict credit limit for the new applicants


Data Availability:
  Data for the case are available in xlsx format.
  The data have been provided for 5000 customers.
  Detailed data dictionary has been provided for understanding the data.
  Data is encoded in the numerical format to reduce the size of the data however some of the variables are categorical. You can find the details in the data dictionary


# As we have 130 columns it will be a little difficult to analyze the data, so using pandas profiling library


Analysis

1) From pandas profiling analysis did dimensionality reduction
2) Missing value imputation
3) outlier capping
4) Encoding
5) Doing dimensionality reduction baesd on Coefficient of variance analysis
6) Target variable is right skewed so doing log transformation to bring it to normal distribution
7) Selecting best features using 1) Correlation 2) RFE 3) F-Regression
8) Consolidating and taking unique set of features based on above 3 approaches
